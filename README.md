## Network Frame Fix
In certain older versions of Plutonium (such as R2905), there exists an issue with the `wait_network_frame()` function, speeding up certain in-game events, most notably the spawnrate of zombies. The **latest** release incorporates a fix for this particular issue, ensuring that gameplay on older Plutonium versions remains legitimate.

## Persistent Upgrades & Bank
When playing tranzit. Upon spawning, players will be awarded all persistent upgrades except insta kill. Player bank will also be set to maximum amount. To change what upgrades are active, use to following boolean console dvars to enable/disable upgrades and bank fill.

`full_bank`  
`pers_jugg`

`pers_carpenter`  
`pers_insta_kill`   
`pers_nube_counter`  
`pers_revivenoperk`
